# Perspicacité — Documentation

Perspicacité is a local-first RAG framework for searching, understanding, and
organizing academic literature. It exposes a web UI, a REST API, a CLI, and an MCP
server — all backed by the same retrieval and reasoning engine.

## Where to start

- **New here?** Read [getting-started.md](getting-started.md) — install, configure,
  create your first KB, and ask your first question in under ten minutes.
- **Want to understand the design?** Read [VISION.md](VISION.md) — the problem this
  project addresses, the design philosophy, and the architecture overview.
- **Looking for a specific feature?** Browse the sections below.
